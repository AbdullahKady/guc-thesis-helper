# GUC Thesis Helper

A chrome extension to help GUC students deal with thesis choosing system

## Installation

To be added, for now: [guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)

## Usage

**Important:** Make sure you're on the `External/Thesis/ChooseThesis.aspx` URL, loading the page while having the window location (the address bar) pointing to other location (_which is the normal behavior if you click on `Choose Thesis` from the admin system_).

To overcome this, simply visit the [URL](http://student.guc.edu.eg/External/Thesis/ChooseThesis.aspx) above, or `CTRL+Click` on the link from the admin system to open in a new tab.

This is done **purposefully**, to minimize the extension's permissions, that way, the extension has no access to the rest of the admin system.
